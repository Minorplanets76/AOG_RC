1. start AOGserver
	- this represents AgOpenGPS

2. start AOG Companion App	
	- this is an app on the same pc as AgOpenGPS
	- up to 5 can be started (or more if needed)
	- each needs a seperate send and receive port

3. start AOGmodule
	- this represents an arduino module (autosteer, rate, etc.)
	- start on another pc on the same network



How the comm works:

1. Arduino modules connect udp or usb to AOG with no changes.  

2. Companion apps connect to AOG over loopback. Up to 5 companion apps can connect, each with a seperate send and receive port.

3. PGNs are in 3 groups:
	- 31000 to 31999 are for AOG
	- 32000 to 32999 are for arduino modules
	- 33000 to 33999 are for companion apps

4. Arduino modules and companion apps all send to AOG. If the PGN is not for AOG it is resent by AOG. 

5. Companion apps can communicate with AOG, other companion apps and modules. Modules can communicate with AOG, other modules and companion apps. AOG can communicate with the modules and companion apps.
