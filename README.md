RateController is an add-on app that works with AgOpenGPS version 5 (https://github.com/farmerbriantee/AgOpenGPS/) for rate control. There is an example rate control pcb and code in the RateController_Files folder of the latest release. It can control up to 16 sections and 5 products either by flow-meter or motor rpm.

To do a simulation:

With AOG running create a new field and turn on the sections.

Install RateController from the install folder. The main window of RC can be dragged to the best location and it will restart at that position. It will stay on top of AOG. Go to settings and load the example file. RC should now show the rate being applied.
