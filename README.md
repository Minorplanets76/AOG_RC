RateController is an add-on app that works with AgOpenGPS version 5 (https://github.com/farmerbriantee/AgOpenGPS/) for rate control. There is rate module code and pcbs for Nano or Teensy. There is switch module code and pcb for Nano. There is a relay controller pcb to mount on 8 or 16 channel relay boards. There is wifi code for ESP8266 microcontroller mounted on some pcbs. It can control up to 16 sections and 5 products either by flow-meter or motor rpm.

To do a simulation:

With AOG running create a new field and turn on the sections.

Install RateController from the install folder. The main window of RC can be dragged to the best location and it will restart at that position. It will stay on top of AOG. Go to settings and load the example file. RC should now show the rate being applied.
