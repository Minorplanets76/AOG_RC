The PCB is missing a couple of components:

The ethernet connector J11 is mounted on the PCB. It plugs into a socket on the underside of the Teensy.
J11	Samtech MTMM-103-10-T-D-355, 9mm post height
	17-2314820-6-ND or 17-2314822-6-ND.	socket



The Deutsch connector J3 can be one of 4 versions A,B,C,D. The matching plug must be of the same version.

A version:

	DT06-12SA	plug 
	0462-201-16141	pin, 12
